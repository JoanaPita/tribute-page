            <h2> Brazillian Rock Band Loved by all</h2>
             <p> Los Hermanos is a rock band from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The group was formed in 1997 by Marcelo Camelo (vocals/guitar), Rodrigo Amarante (guitar/vocals), Rodrigo Barba (drums), and Bruno Medina (keyboards/keyboard bass). Currently they are on an extended hiatus, performing some concerts sporadically. </p> 

            <h2> Formation and first years (1997–99) </h2>
                <p> Then students from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Marcelo Camelo (Journalism), and Rodrigo Barba (Psychology) formed a band that mixed the hardcore influences with the lightness of lyrics about love.[1] In addition, the band had a saxophonist, and, later, the keyboardist Bruno Medina, Advertising student at the same college, was incorporated to the group. When the musicians Rodrigo Amarante (vocals, guitar and percussion) and Patrick Laplan (bass) joined the band, and with the output of three musicians of their formation (trumpeter Marcio and saxophonists Carlos and Victor), they recorded in 1997 their first material, the demos "Chora" and "Amor e Folia."</p>

                <p>The demos affected the underground scene of Rio de Janeiro and later the Los Hermanos were called to play at the "Superdemos", a great independent music festival from Rio, and festival Abril Pro Rock, in Recife, Pernambuco. </p>
